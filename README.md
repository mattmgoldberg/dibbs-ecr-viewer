# Overview

This repository is a part of the CDC DIBBs project and contains the core software for the DIBBs eCR Viewer.

The eCR Viewer is a tool that provides a human-readable view of eCR (electronic case reporting) documents, making it easier for public health staff to find relevant information in an eCR. It combines both the electronic initial case report (eICR) and Reportability Response (RR) into a single view and highlights relevant lab or clinical information for conditions present in the eCR. It is designed for case investigators, eCR coordinators, and others who review eCRs.

There are three eCR Viewer options:

1. Integrated eCR Viewer \- The eCR Viewer built directly into NBS (National Electronic Disease Surveillance System Base System) or EpiTrax, providing a standardized way to view an individual eCR within those systems
2. Standalone eCR Library \- A separate tool public health agencies (PHAs) can use to manage and view eCR documents outside their surveillance system; it uses the same eCR Viewer as the integrated version for individual views of an eCR
3. Dual-boot mode \- Allows PHAs to access the eCR Viewer from two different entry points: either through NBS/EpiTrax (integrated) or through the eCR Library

# Problem Scope

Electronic Case Reporting (eCR) provides a valuable way to share data between electronic health records and PHAs. However, because these files contain a large volume of information and the formatting often varies, it can take extra time and effort for epidemiologists and case investigators to locate the specific clinical and lab details needed for their work.

The eCR Viewer simplifies the process of reviewing eCRs for public health staff. It solves the problem of navigating scattered and dense data through a single, intuitive web interface that highlights and organizes relevant information in eCR documents.

Our overall objective is to help the CDC best support PHAs in moving towards a modern public health data infrastructure. See our [public demo website](https://dibbs.tools/) for more details.

# Product Vision

The eCR Viewer is a public health surveillance tool (i.e., not a clinical tool, a billing tool, an insurance tool, a patient portal, etc.).

To maintain the stability, reliability, and core functionality of the eCR Viewer, the following boundaries define acceptable changes, updates, and customizations for future maintainers and contributors. These boundaries ensure that we do not compromise the core architecture or negatively impact other users of the eCR Viewer. We encourage you to fork this repository if you would like to build a custom implementation that falls outside the boundaries established here.

## Database & Schema Management

For the database required by the eCR Library, the boundaries are defined as follows:

- **Core and Extended Schemas:** These schemas hold the essential architecture required for the eCR Library to function and provide a comprehensive view of eCR data. No modifications are permitted to either schema to ensure stability.
- **Customized Schemas:** Contributors can fork or configure their own customized schemas for the eCR Viewer. To use a customized schema, implementing teams are entirely responsible for writing the supporting code, changing the necessary environmental variables, and maintaining that custom codebase.
- **Database Compatibility:** The eCR Viewer architecture currently supports SQL Server and PostgreSQL for storing metadata.
  - Future updates or contributions may introduce compatibility for other relational database types that are supported by [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/docs/dialects).

## eCR Data Mutability and Presentation

The core purpose of the eCR Viewer is presentation, not data entry or modification. To uphold this boundary, contributors must not introduce or accept architectural changes that allow users to edit or modify eCR data.

Based on organizational priorities, there is scope for expanding eCR Viewer capacity to visualize the data in ways that improve case investigation.

## Identity Providers

The eCR Viewer architecture is designed to be flexible regarding authentication and permits the integration of additional Identity Providers to accommodate organizational needs.

## Healthcare Data Specifications

The eCR Viewer supports the following healthcare data specifications:

- **FHIR Support:** The eCR Viewer exclusively supports FHIR R4. (For more details on our FHIR implementation, please refer to the [Relevant HL7 Implementation Guides & Specifications wiki](https://github.com/CDCgov/dibbs-FHIR-Converter/wiki/Relevant-HL7-Implementation-Guides-&-Specifications)).
- **eCR Support:** The eCR Viewer supports eCR version 3.1.1 and earlier.
- **Version Floor:** While we are backwards compatible for eCR version, any earlier versions of FHIR will not be supported or rendered by the Viewer.

# Deployment Instructions

The eCR Viewer ecosystem relies on modular building blocks and infrastructure repositories and runs as a set of containers connected on a shared network. While each container is an independent service, they work together in a coordinated pipeline.

The services that make up the stack are:

- **eCR-viewer:** The portal to view eCRs. Requires environment variables for storage, authentication, and connecting to the orchestration service.
- **Ingestion:** Standardizes data fields from FHIR bundles. No environment variables required.
- **fhir-converter:** Converts eCRs to FHIR format. No environment variables required.
- **fhir-converter-proxy (optional):** An HAProxy load balancer that distributes workloads by routing incoming eCR payloads across multiple FHIR Converter instances. Requires environment variables for configuration.
- **message-parser:** Extracts fields from FHIR bundles for database storage. No environment variables required.
- **trigger-code-reference:** “Stamps” FHIR bundles with SNOMED condition codes. No environment variables required.
- **Orchestration:** Configuration-driven engine that chains the backend services together. Requires environment variables pointing to each service URL.

## Deployment Scripts

Below are the resources needed to deploy the application

- [dibbs-ecr-viewer/deployment](https://github.com/CDCgov/dibbs-ecr-viewer/tree/main/deployment/README.md) \- Instructions intended build a lower level understanding of how the system fits together. \`docker run\` commands, including minimum required environment variables and service start order.
- [dibbs-ecr-viewer/deployment/vm](https://github.com/CDCgov/dibbs-ecr-viewer/tree/main/deployment/vm) – For provisioning and managing an eCR Viewer deployment on an Ubuntu VM. Uses bash scripts and Docker Compose to start the containers. Includes a bash script to assist in environment variable setup.

## Archived Example Repositories
